					<h4>1. Purpose and scope</h4>
					<p>This procedure ensures that if and when an incident occurs or a complaint is received, the circumstances are investigated and appropriate short-term and long-term corrective action is taken. Corrective actions shall be reviewed for effectiveness after an appropriate period of time.</p>
                    <h4 class="m-t-20">2. Responsibility</h4>
                    <p>All staff is responsible for reporting incidents. The Director in conjunction with other managers agrees what corrective action is required and ensures that the action is taken and is effective and reviewed.</p>
                    <h4 class="m-t-20">3. Incidents</h4>
                    <p>Incidents may arise from:</p>
                    <p>A failure to observe Operating Procedures</p>
                    <p>An inadequate Operating Procedure</p>
                    <p>Unforeseen circumstances, e.g. abnormal operating conditions</p>
                    <p>Complaints</p>
                    <h4 class="m-t-20">4. Registering the incident</h4>
                    <p>Incidents shall be recorded in the Non-conformance section of this system.</p>
                    <h4 class="m-t-20">5. Corrective action</h4>
                    <p>Action to prevent recurrence of identified issues - or subsequent similar issues - is considered to be part of the corrective action process.</p>
                    <h4 class="m-t-20">6. Evaluation of Effectiveness</h4>
                    <p>The Director shall in due course check that the corrective action has been completed and that it has been effective, or is likely to be effective, in preventing a repeat of the incident.</p>
                    <h4 class="m-t-20">7. Reporting to management</h4>
                    <p>A summary of previous corrective actions and non-conformities is reported to the management review meeting.</p>
                    <p>Management Reviews are used to review the management system and to identify areas of potential concern and required action to be taken to prevent problems before they occur. In particular future changes likely to impact the business and management system are identified, and where appropriate projects and training programmes are established to ensure these changes are managed to prevent issues arising. These meetings also review actions already taken in respect of such potential issues. Records for management review meetings are maintained by this system..</p>
